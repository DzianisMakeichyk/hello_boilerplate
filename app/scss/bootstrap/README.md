# Bootstrap 4 Grid System (Flex)

Bootstrap 4 grid system and layout utilities.

## Version

Currently v4.0.0-beta.2
<br/>
[Origin Version](https://github.com/m-spyratos/bootstrap-4-grid) 

## What's Included

* [Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
* [Layout Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/utilities-for-layout/)

## Why?

Here's what you get that Bootstrap 4 currently doesn't provide out of the box:

* [Grid Equal-Width Multi-Row](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#equal-width-multi-row)
* [Sizing Utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/sizing/)
* [Display Utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/)
* [Spacing Utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/)
* [Visibility Utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/visibility/)

If you don't need any of the above, Bootstrap 4 already includes a grid only version with its
[Bootstrap CSS and JS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/#compiled-css-and-js) bundle.
